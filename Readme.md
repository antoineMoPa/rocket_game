# What is this?

A small rocket game built with vue.js and a GLSL shader.

# Tell me something interesting

The stars, asteroids and the rocket are made with code, no svg (except for the HUD).

# Known problems

On some platform/graphics-card/browser combinations, the smoke goes sideways.

# LICENSE

The fragment shader (frag.glsl) and the images (images folder) are available under the Creative Commons CC BY-NC 3.0
license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/).

The rest (javascript, html, CSS) is available under the terms of the GNU general public license version 3.

What this means is that you can create your own game and publish it, but you must write a new fragment shader (I suggest you also change the JS code to make something different, but it is up to you).

The sound effects have their own license found in their respective folders. Some sound effects I used are in the public domain.
