Q: I know you say your music is free. Can I make money from it?
A: Yes! The only restrictions on our music are:	

1) You may NOT re-sell it as-is, (it MUST be used as part of some other creation like a video, audio re-mix, podcast, video game, commercial or on-hold telephone message) 

2) You cannot claim the music as yours or deploy it in such a way that would prevent others from using the music as you have.
